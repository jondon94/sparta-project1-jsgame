# 2D Sparta Platformer

## The Game
This game is a 2D platformer similar to other games such as Super Meat Boy.
There are basic movement controls in the game.
The Aim of the game is to get through all the levels, there is no scoring system meaning it is a win/lose game.

The basic premise of the game is that you awaken in Hell and must escape by passing all the levels to reach the surface. There are no enemies only obstacles.

_Instructions_:
>The game has very basic controls. To get past each level the player must move the character. This is done by pressing the arrows keys.

* Up Arrow = jump
* Left Arrow = move left
* Right Arrow = move right
* Down Arrow = duck

## The Task
For this project the main focus of development relied on collision (Getting the character to interact with the environment). The environment was difficult to introduce but using a  canvas made the whole situation easier by giving everything 'context' within said canvas.

_User Stories Delivered_:
* Visible Character during Gameplay
* Moveable Character during Gameplay
* Player Character interacts with environment correctly i.e. death upon contact with flames/saw blades or passing the level by reaching the door.
* Appropriate graphics for each element
* Introducing a win/lose event.
* All relevant info displayed in each level.

_What went well & Difficulties_:
>I am pleased I managed to get collisions working properly as that was the most difficult part in he actual mechanics of the game, but also how I got the character to move on pressing the right buttons.
